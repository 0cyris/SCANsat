LICENSING INFORMATION FOR MODELS AND TEXTURES
---------------------------------------------

Models and textures for the two altimetry sensors as well as the multispectral
(biome and anomaly) sensor were created by Milkshakefiend. Original forum thread:
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49233-WIP-Parts-from-my-garden-shed-SCANsat-Antennae

All Rights Reserved - Milkshakefiend / Myles Hill

Milkshakefiend has given permission that these models and textures may be
distributed with SCANsat, including derived works, as long as credit is given.


LICENSING INFORMATION FOR LOGO
---------------------------------------------

The logo was created by K3 | Chris in #kspmodders, and originally by the
United States National Reconnaissance Office. Since they are a U.S. government
organization, their logo patch is public domain, and therefore so is this logo.
