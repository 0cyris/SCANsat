Build 3 - 2013-11-02
--------------------

- Map overlays are rendered in a more efficient way. (DMagic, OrtwinS)

- The polar orthographic projection doesn't choke on the antimeridian 
  anymore. (DMagic)

- Greyscale mode changes more colors to barrier free colors.

- The big map is now resizable and its size and position are saved in the 
  persistance file.

- Map markers now use the stock KSP icons, if applicable. (Sochin)

- More text has black outlines now to make it more readable.

- Map markers and the ground track are now visible in the zoom box. (Ortwins)

- Polar projection now displays handy S and N markers. (Thourion, OrtwinS)

- All parts now consume electrical charge. The amounts are not finalized yet
  but can be configured in the part.cfg files.

- Slope detection has been folded into altimetry. (OrtwinS)

- Existing slope sensors have become broken, and a small explosive charge has
  been activated remotely for your convenience. You can trigger it via the
  right-click menu to get rid of the part on existing vessels.

- If there are maneuver nodes on the active orbit during the time span for 
  which the ground track is rendered, the first maneuver node's position will
  be indicated on the ground track along with the ground track for one period
  of the resulting orbit.

- The GUI style should not flip between Unity and KSP style. (BananaDealer)

- Rendered maps are not exported automatically anymore. Instead, there's a
  button in the big map window that exports the current map without any of
  the overlays. Exported images are still saved in the same location. (MOARdV)

- Flags are now visible on the map.

- Double clicking a ship name in the small window now switches to that ship.

- The vessel list in the small window can now be toggled, and the window can
  be minimized to an icon only. (OrtwinS)
  
  

Build 2 - 2013-10-31
--------------------

- BTDT scanner now correctly works when the vessel is below 2000m above ground,
  instead of when the anomaly is below 2000m above sea level. (DMagic)

- Main UI now correctly shows the altitude of the vessel above ground, instead 
  of the terrain elevation above sea level below the vessel.
  
- Big map mouseover text now displays latitude and longitude in the correct 
  order. (DMagic)
  
- Geographical coordinates are now displayed in DMS. (Sochin, GhostChaser)

- Left-clicking inside the zoom box now zooms back out. (OrtwinS)

- Big map now shows a projection of the active vessel's current orbit from one
  orbital period in the past to one orbital period in the future. (Sochin)
  
- Big map now shows predicted equatorial crossings for the next few dozen orbits.

- Big map can now be rendered using the Kavrayskiy VII projection. (OrtwinS)

- Big map can now be rendered using a Polar Orthographic projection. (OrtwinS)

- A red scanning line indicates big map rendering progress. (Thourion)

- When using greyscale, text labels are displayed in cyan and orange. (sharpspoonful)

- Text labels on maps now have a black outline. (OrtwinS)

- The UI doesn't go AWOL anymore if you switch vessels in map view. (Tutman, DMagic)

- The small map doesn't paint elevations <-1500m red in greyscale mode anymore.

- Areas not covered by all active sensors on your active vessel now appear
  darker on the small map. 

- There's a switchable dot line grid on the big map. (OrtwinS)

- Map markers can be toggled in big map. (DMagic, OrtwinS)

- The zoom box acquired a close button. (Ralathon, DMagic, OrtwinS)
