BEFORE NEXT BUILD:
-

MUST FIX BEFORE RELEASE:
- Make "big" map output size configurable
- Use electrical charge
- Scanning a planet, discovering anomalies etc. should give science
- science ... based upon the percentage of mapped terrain? A few points for every 10% for example, slowly increasing since 0->10% isn't as much of an achievement than 70->80 is (OrtwinS, Draft, BananaDealer)
- science for detected anomalies etc. (BananaDealer)
- proper integration into tech tree
- Fix all the bugs

MINE:
- Find a way to see progress for other scan types than altimetry on the minimap
- add more anomalies, e.g. "highest elevation"

OTHERS:
- Icons instead of lame text based markers (Sochin)
- Can we get a table/list of detected anomalies? That would be excellent, even if it's only from a text file in the data directory. (Free Trader Beowulf)
- Different colors for temporary textures of the parts (Ralathon)
- visible band scanner for pretty pictures (Nertea) 
   - planet texture overlaid with greyscale elevation map?
- overlaying the planets in the stock map view with your generated images, showing them as a solid colour if they haven't been mapped? (pizzaoverhead)
- Adjust action group function name, all sensors now say: 'start/stop RADAR scan' (OrtwinS)
- make image export configurable (MOARdV)
- show map markers in zoom window (OrtwinS)
